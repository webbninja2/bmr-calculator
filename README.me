## BMR Calculator

The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator estimates your basal metabolic rateâ€”the amount of energy expended 
while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, 
and in a post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about 12 hours of fasting).
